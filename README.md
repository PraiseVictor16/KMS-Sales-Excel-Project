# Case 7 Explained
If the Delivery truck was economical but the slowest and Express air was the fastest but most expensive, the company didn't spend shipping costs according to order priority but according to what costs less.

According to the dataset, the orders were classified as either critical, high, low, medium or not specified. However, in each order priority apart from the one not specified, the delivery truck costed more. 

If it was the slowest but most economical, the company did not make the right choice because customers value their orders to be treated with urgency. For an order priority to be critical and the company utilizes the slowest means to serve its customers because of the shipping costs, they are at the verge of losing customers. Shipping methods should be carried out based on the urgency of the order. KMS' current approach in shipping is cost-driven and not customer-centric.

My recommendation would be for the company to add the cost of shipping to the price of the products sold if the customers want their orders to be delivered in time. In other words, customers can have dynamic shipping options with conditions. For example, if customers want faster delivery, they know it would cost more based on the shipping option available and the price attached to it.
Also, further analysis can be conducted to know how the shipping speed correlates with customers satisfaction.

# Recommendation 
To increase the revenue from the bottom customers, the store can:
* Cross-sell. For example, the store can offer discounts on office supplies when purchasing appliances in order to encourage customers to add more items to their cart and increase their purchase value.
* Offer personalized product recommendations {If the company has the email addresses of these customers, personalized emails can be sent to them regularly showing product suggestions based on their past purchases}.
* Offer exclusive deals {like free installation of office supplies, appliances, or furniture after buying goods worth a particular amount}.
